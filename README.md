# Advanced Quantization:  A practical Course

This course provides a hands-on introduction to *extreme model quantization*, *hardware-aware optimization*, and *on-device deployment* for generative AI models. You'll explore advanced techniques to reduce model size, accelerate inference, and deploy compact LLMs on edge devices like Android smartphones. 

This course is Part 1 of a two‑part Advanced AI series. For Part 2, focusing on Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, see the companion material: **[Mixture of Experts: A Practical Course](https://github.com/arm-university/Advanced-AI-Mixture-of-Experts)**.

## Intended Audience

This course is designed for industry ML engineers who want practical, ready-to-adapt examples for integrating advanced optimization techniques into their own applications. It is also well-suited for ML researchers interested in exploring and experimenting with cutting‑edge methods for model compression and performance optimization.

Learners should be comfortable with the following

- **Deep learning architectures** — transformers, attention mechanisms, and feed-forward networks  
- **Training and optimization** — gradient descent variants, regularization, and overfitting control  
- **Practical skills** — Python programming experience and intermediate understanding of PyTorch  

Those who want to build or refresh these fundamentals can first complete introductory and intermediate material such as the [Intro to AI](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/arm-education-introduction-to-ai) or [Optimizing Generative AI on Arm](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/arm-education-ai-on-arm) course.


## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: **Extreme Quantization**
Train a language model and progressively quantize it from FP32 to 8-bit, 4-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit precision. Implement and evaluate **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** to mitigate accuracy degradation in ultra-low-bit models.

### Lab 2: **Hardware–Software Model Co-Design**
Wrap all `nn.Linear` layers with a custom `QLinear` module and explore **layerwise post-training quantization**. Search for the optimal bit-width configuration to maximize efficiency while maintaining model fidelity in a software-hardware co-design process.

### Lab 3: **Running & Quantizing Models on Android**
Use [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to quantize and deploy LLaMA-style LLMs on Android. Learn how to benchmark and run models *offline*, directly on your mobile hardware.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This course runs cross‑platform and has been validated on an NVIDIA DGX Spark; for training the models, we recommend using an accelerated backend such as a GPU. It is expected that you are familiar with configuring software across different operating systems, and you may need to install additional packages depending on your environment.

This repository uses a unified `requirements.txt` and Git LFS to manage dependencies and large pretrained models.

### 1️. Clone the Repository and Download Model Weights

```bash
# Install Git LFS if needed
sudo apt install git-lfs              # or: brew install git-LFS
git lfs install

# Clone the repo and pull large files
git clone https://github.com/arm-university/Advanced-AI-Hardware-Software-Co-Design.git
cd Advanced-AI-Hardware-Software-Co-Design
git lfs pull
```

### 2️. Set Up the Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️. Run the Labs

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open:

- `lab1.ipynb` for **Extreme Quantization**
- `lab2.ipynb` for **Hardware–Software Co-Design**
- Follow `lab3.md` for **Android deployment** with `llama.cpp`

## Android Deployment Notes

To complete **Lab 3**, make sure the following are installed:

- Android Studio (Hedgehog or later)
- Android NDK + ADB
- A physical Android 10+ device with ≥6GB RAM

> Windows users: use **WSL 2** with Ubuntu 22.04 for full compatibility with build tools.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand bit-width trade-offs (accuracy vs. compression)
- Apply QAT to recover performance in quantized models
- Perform per-layer hardware-aware optimization
- Deploy and benchmark local LLMs on Android devices

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
