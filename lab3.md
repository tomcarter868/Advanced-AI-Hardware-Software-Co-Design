---

## Step 1: Install Android Studio and Set Up the SDK

Android Studio includes all the tools needed to build and debug Android apps, including **ADB** (installed automatically as part of the Platform-Tools).

1. Download and install **Android Studio** on your computer.  
2. During setup, ensure the following components are selected:  
   - **Android SDK**  
   - **SDK Platform Tools** (includes ADB — no separate install required)  
   - **NDK**  
3. In **Settings → Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK**, verify:  
   - SDK path: `~/Android/Sdk/`  
   - NDK version ≥ 25  
   - Platform-Tools version ≥ 34  
4. *(Optional)* Add the tools directory to your shell `PATH` so you can run ADB from any terminal:  
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Android/Sdk/platform-tools
   ```
   
---

## Step 2: Authenticate with Hugging Face

We use Hugging Face to download a pretrained Llama-style model.

**On your computer**, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli login
```

1. Log in at [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co).
2. Go to **Settings → Access Tokens**.
3. Create a token with **Read** access.
4. Paste the token in your terminal.

---

## Step 3: Clone & Build `llama.cpp`

This builds the tools used to convert and quantize models:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS=ON
make
```

> 🧪 **Why:** This creates binaries like `llama-quantize` and `llama-run`, which are used to transform and test models.

---

## Step 4: Set Up a Workspace for Models

**On your computer**, run:

```bash
cd ..
mkdir llama-models && cd llama-models
```

>  Organizing models in one place keeps your workflow tidy.

---

## Step 5: Download a Pretrained 3B Llama model

**On your computer**, run:

```bash
huggingface-cli download unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct --repo-type model --local-dir ./Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct
```

>  **Tip:** Use a 1B model variant for devices with less RAM and storage.

---

## Step 6: Convert Huggingface model to GGUF Format

**On your computer**, run:

```bash
cd ../
python convert_hf_to_gguf.py llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct --outfile llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf
```

>  **Why GGUF?** It's the native `llama.cpp` format that enables fast, memory-mapped loading and is portable across platforms.

---

## Step 7: Quantize the Model

Quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of the model's weights from 32-bit floating point numbers to lower bit representations (like 8-bit, 4-bit or even 2-bit integers). This significantly reduces model size and speeds up inference, with minimal impact on accuracy when done carefully.

For example, a 3B parameter model normally requires ~12GB in FP32. After quantization:
- Q8_0 (8-bit) reduces it to ~3GB
- Q4_K_M (4-bit) reduces it to ~1.5GB  
- TQ2_0 (2-bit) reduces it to ~750MB

To Quantize, we can use the llama.cpp tools. **On your computer**, run:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-quantize llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q8_0 Q8_0
./build/bin/llama-quantize llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q4_K_M Q4_K_M
./build/bin/llama-quantize llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-TQ2_0 TQ2_0
```

| Format   | Bitwidth | Trade-off                 |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Q8_0    | 8-bit    | High accuracy, large size |
| Q4_K_M | 4-bit    | Balance of sizespeed     |
| TQ2_0   | ~2-bit  | Tiny, fast, less accurate |

>  **Why Quantize?** Reduces memory and compute cost, enabling real-time use on mobile.

---

## Step 8: Test Inference Locally

**On your computer**, run:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-run llama-models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q8_0 "What is quantization in the context of machine learning?"
```

>  Sanity check the model before deploying to Android. The command should output a response from the model to your terminal.

---

## Step 9: Open the Android App Project

**In Android Studio on your computer**:

- Open `llama.cpp/examples/llama.android`
- Wait for Gradle sync (this may take 10-15 minutes)
- Switch to "Project" view for easier navigation. You can do this by selecting 'Android' in the top left of your screen, then selecting 'project' from the dropdown. 

---

## Step 10: Enable Debugging mode and modify the app to use local models

First to enable debugging mode on your phone, do the following on your **mobile**:

1. Enable USB debugging in Developer Options of you mobile:
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **About phone**
   - Tap **Build number** 7 times to enable Developer options 
   - Return to **Settings** > **Developer options**
   - Toggle on **USB debugging**

**Then In Android Studio on your computer**, edit the following files:

**Edit** `llama.android/app/src/java/com.example.llama/MainActivity.kt`
Replace the `models = listOf(...)` section with:

```kotlin
val models = listOf(
    Downloadable("Llama-3.2-3B-q8", Uri.EMPTY, File(extFilesDir, "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q8_0")),
    Downloadable("Llama-3.2-3B-q4", Uri.EMPTY, File(extFilesDir, "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q4_K_M")),
    Downloadable("Llama-3.2-3B-q2", Uri.EMPTY, File(extFilesDir, "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-TQ2_0")),
)
```

**Edit** `Downloadable.kt`
Replace the entire `@Composable fun Button(...)` implementation with:

```kotlin
@JvmStatic
@Composable
fun Button(viewModel: MainViewModel, dm: DownloadManager, item: Downloadable) {
    val fileExists = item.destination.exists()

    fun onClick() {
        if (fileExists) {
            viewModel.load(item.destination.path)
        }
    }

    Button(onClick = { onClick() }, enabled = fileExists) {
        Text(if (fileExists) "Load ${item.name}" else "${item.name} - Not found")
    }
}
```

Press the Play button <img src="assets/lab3/play.png" alt="Llama Android App UI" width="30"/> in android studio to push the application to the device, and initialize the activation space. We haven't pushed the models yet so you won't be able to load them. We can fix that in the next step. 

---

## Step 11: Push Quantized Models to Android Device

1. Connect your device via USB cable and authorize your computer when prompted

2. Push the model files to device:

```bash
adb push llama-models/*gguf* /sdcard/Android/data/com.example.llama/files/
```

Verify the files have been transferred with:

```bash
adb shell ls /sdcard/Android/data/com.example.llama/files/
```

It should output something like this:

```bash
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q4_K_M
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-Q8_0
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-gguf-TQ2_0
```

---

## Step 12: Build and Run the App

**In Android Studio on your computer**, press the **Run** button <img src="assets/lab3/play.png" alt="Llama Android App UI" width="30"/>. The app will install on your device and open automatically.

---

## Step 13: Use the App 🌟

With the app installed and your models loaded onto the device, it's time to interact with them **on your Android phone**.

###  User Interface Overview

When the app opens **on your phone**, you'll see a simple interface with buttons to select your model, a text input field, and action buttons:

<img src="assets/lab3/llamaapp_im1.jpeg" alt="Llama Android App UI" width="300"/>

- **Load**: Select one of the quantized models you pushed earlier.
- **Text Field**: Type your prompt or question.
- **Send**: Run inference on-device and receive a generated response.

This setup lets you evaluate both the usability and responsiveness of different quantized versions of the same model.

>  **Note:** Only one model can be loaded per app session. To switch models, fully close the app and rerun it via Android Studio.

---

### Benchmarking Model Performance

To evaluate how each quantized model performs, tap the **Bench** button after loading a model.  
This runs a **built-in benchmarking routine** that measures how efficiently the model processes and generates tokens on your device.  
The benchmark reports two key metrics:

- **Prompt processing speed (pp)** — measures how quickly the model encodes the input prompt **before generation begins**.  
  This reflects the **forward pass performance** when the full prompt is fed to the model (e.g., how many input tokens per second it can process per second). It is usually a compute bound stage.

- **Token generation speed (tg)** — measures how fast the model **generates output tokens** during the autoregressive decoding phase.  
  Each new token depends on the previously generated context, making this step more **memory-bound**.

Repeat this process for each model variant (e.g., Q8, Q4, Q2) to compare how quantization impacts runtime efficiency.

Your output should resemble:

<img src="assets/lab3/llamaapp_q8.jpeg" alt="Benchmark Results for Q8 Model" width="300"/>

Then summarize your results in a table:

| Quant | Prompt Processing (pp) | Token Generation (tg) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Q8     | 11.0 tokens/s          | 6.8 tokens/s           |
| Q4     | 12.0 tokens/s          | 7.1 tokens/s           |
| Q2     | 9.7 tokens/s           | 10.0 tokens/s          |

> 💡 **Insight:**  
> Quantization can reduce precision slightly but improves memory usage and inference speed.  
> The gain is most visible during **token generation**, which is typically the most time- and memory-intensive phase of autoregressive decoding.

This step provides both a **quantitative measure** of on-device efficiency and a **qualitative sense** of responsiveness across different quantization levels.

## 🎓 Course Summary: What We've Learned

Across the three labs in this course, you've gained hands-on experience with the complete pipeline for deploying efficient AI models on mobile devices:

### Lab 1: Extreme Quantization Fundamentals
- Trained a baseline FP32 language model and progressively quantized to 8-bit → 4-bit → 2-bit → 1-bit
- Observed accuracy degradation with extreme compression (1-bit = 32× size reduction)
- Implemented extreme ternary/binary quantization techniques
- Recovered accuracy using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to achieve near-FP32 performance

### Lab 2: Hardware-Software Co-Design
- Implemented `QLinear` layers with integer-only GEMM operations
- Applied per-layer mixed-precision quantization (8/4/2-bit) using post-training techniques
- Profiled model size vs. cross-entropy to measure layer-specific sensitivity
- Performed automated bit-width search to optimize hardware-aware objective functions

### Lab 3: Real-World Mobile Deployment on ARM
- Deployed quantized LLMs on ARM-based Android devices using `llama.cpp`
- Benchmarked performance: aggressive quantization (Q2) can **double generation speed** while reducing model size by ~4x
- Experienced the practical benefits: reduced latency, offline capability, enhanced privacy

**Key Insight**: Quantization enables the impossible—running billion-parameter models on ARM phones. The 3B Llama model went from ~12GB (unusable on mobile) to ~750MB-3GB (runs smoothly on a typical phone).

### Further Exploration
- Experiment with **different model sizes** (1B vs 3B vs 7B) on your device
- Try **custom prompts** to test model quality across quantization levels
- Explore **llama.cpp's quantization formats**: Q5_K_M, Q6_K for different accuracy/speed balances
- Read the [llama.cpp documentation](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) for advanced optimization flags
- Check out [GGUF model benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-arena) for community performance comparisons
